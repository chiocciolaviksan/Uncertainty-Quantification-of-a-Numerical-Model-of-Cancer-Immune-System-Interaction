The codes presented have been developed in relation to the Master's thesis 
entitled "Uncertainty Quantification of a Numerical Model for Organs-on-Chip: 
Towards a Better Understanding of Cancer-Immune System Interaction." 

For proper functionality, the installation of the Sparse-grid Matlab Kit is required, 
available at the following link: https://sites.google.com/view/sparse-grids-kit 
(releases, documentation, release-related material) 
as well as on GitHub at https://github.com/lorenzo-tamellini/sparse-grids-matlab-kit (source code). 

Furthermore, the codes included in this folder
do not encompass those developed by Dr. Bertoluzza, 
for which it is necessary to contact her personally 
(please refer to her personal page at https://imati.cnr.it/mypage.php?idk=PG-66).
